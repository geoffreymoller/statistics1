Histograms!

* Used to display a distribution
* Great to overcome the natural tendency to rely upon summary information, such as an average
* Can reveal info not captured by summary statistics

Viewing a hist often reveals whether a distribution is normal or not normal
  - sometimes hard to determine, but then we can use summary stastics to help

"The skew is where there's few"

Bimodal - evidence of two peaks

Examples of non-normal distributions:
  - Bi-modal
  - Positively Skewed
  - Negatively Skewed
  - Uniform (platykurtic)
  - Leptokurtic
