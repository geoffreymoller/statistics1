***********
- Nothing beats a simple elegaant randomized controlled experiment for correlation, causality

- The multiple regression examples were complicated, considering the limitations placed on the final interpretations, for ex:
  - The slope for X is B
  - But if you add another X the slope changes
  -or-
  - X & Y are correlated
  - But if you add a moderator variable,
  - X & Y are not correlated

- Let's assume a simple experimental desgin
  - Independent variable
    - Vaccine
    - Placebo
  - Dependent variable
    - Rate of polio

  - Two means can be compared using a t-test
    - NHST can be conducted, yielding a p-value
    - Effect size can also be calculated
    - Confidence intervals around the sample means can also be reported

- There are different kinds of tests that compare means
  - z-test
  - t-test (single sample)
  - t-test (dependent)
  - t-test (independent)

  - Why is it called Student's t-test?
    - Developed by William Gossett in 1908
      - To monitor the quality of stout beer at the Guiness brewerey in Dublin, Ireland
      - Managment at Guiness considered their process a secret so they convinced Gossett to publish his work using the pen name "Student"

  Designed to compare means
    z = (Observed - Expected) / SE
    t = (Observed - Expected) / SE
    "We need to get a difference in the numerator that's at least 2x compared to what happens duet to chance to claim that you have a statistically sigfinicant effect"

  z-test: pretty rare
    - When comparing a sample mean to a population mean and the standard deviation of the population is known <- RARE
  Single sample t-test: pretty rare
    - When comparing a sample mean to a population mean and the standard deviation of the population is not known <- RARE

    Dependent t-test
      - When evaluating the difference between two related samples
        - (same people measured twice)
        - calc different score and see if the mean different score is different from 0 => signficant change
    Independent t-test  
      - When evaluating the difference between two independent samples
        - (men v women, vaccinated v placebo, etc)
 
Exact p-values depends on:
  - Directional or non-directional test
  - Degrees of freedom (df)
    - Different t-distributions for different sample sizes

  - if you do a z test, your sampling distribution  is mean 0 normal dist
    - cutoff for alpha .05 for is 1.96 => beyond 1.96 is significant for z-test at alpha .05

  - if you do a t test you have your family of t distributions
    - p-value is the area under the curve at that point and beyond
      - if you get a really low one => extreme value, reject the null
