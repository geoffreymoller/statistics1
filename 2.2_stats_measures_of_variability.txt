* sd: the average deviation from the mean in a distribution
* variation: sd^2

M = (∑X) / N
SD^2 = [∑(X-M)^2]/N - for descriptive statistics
SD^2 = [∑(X-M)^2]/(N-1) - for inferential statistics

Z-Score = (X-M)/SD
  - Number of standard deviations an observation or datum is above the mean.
  - The Z-scale is the standard scale in statistics
  - Raw scores can be converted to Z-scores
  - Z-scores can be used to find percentile rank
  - The mean Z-score is Z = 0
  - Positive Z scores are above average
  - Negative Z scores are below average

Percentile Rank
  - the percentage of scores that fall at or below a score in a distribution
  - assume a normal dist
  - if Z = 0 then the percentile rank = 50th
  - 50 percent of the distribution falls below the mean
