NHST

***********
* SUMMARY *
***********
NHST is a procedure for hypothesis testing
Requires a binary decision
  - Reject or retain the null hypothesis
Four possible outcomes
  - Great: Correct retention, correction rejection
  - Errors: False Alarm (Type I error), Miss(Type II error)

"A game we play as scientists who do research"
Some say we should stop playing this game, ban it from scientific research

"Null hypothesis assumes there is no relationship between the variables"

H0 = null hypothesis
  - for example, r = 0
  - for example, B = 0
  - for example, B = 0

HA = alternative hypothesis
  - for example, r > 0 
  - for example, B > 0
  - for example, B != 0 (non-directional test)

If the alternative hypothesis predicts the direction of the relationship between X & Y (positive vs. negative)
- Directional test
- Otherwise it is known as a non-directional test

!!! Assume H0 is true, then calculate the probability of observing data with these characteristics, given that H0 is true
  p = P(D|H0)
  if p is very low, then reject H0, else retain H0

p-value (statistically significance) comes from the null hypothesis:
  Given that the null hypothesis is true, the probability of these, or more extreme data, is p
  IT'S NOT: the probability of the null hypothesis being true is p
  IOW: P(D|H0) != P(H0|D)
  "probability of obtaning those data, given the assumption that there was no effect/relationship in the study/experiment)

Review, as it pertains to NHST:
  r - is the correlation significantly different from zero?
  B - is the slope of the regression line for X significantly different from zero?

The way to get to a p-value, we must first calculate a t-value
  t = B/SE (regression coefficient relative to the standard error)
      - where standard error is how much sampling error we're going to get due to chance
      => Most NHSTs are ratios, and are basically:
        "What did you observe, relative to what do you expect just due to chance"
        => if what we observed is much higher than that due to chance => HIGH t-value => low p-value
    - B is the undstandardized regression coefficient
    - SE = standard error
    - SE = SQRT[SS.residual/(N - 2)]
