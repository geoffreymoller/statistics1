Important Topics
* Simple regression vs multiple regression
* Regression equation
* Regression model

* Correlations are good for prediction
  - use one to predict the other

* Regression: a statistical analyis used to predict scores on an outcome variable, based on scores on one or multiple predictor variables

* Simple Regression: one predictor variable
* Multiple Regression: multiple predictors

Regression Equation:
http://janda.org/c10/Lectures/topic04/L25-Modeling.htm

Notation 1: Y = mX + b + e
- Y is a linear function of X
- m = slope
- b = intercept
- e = error (residual)

Notation 2:
  Y = B0 + B1X1 + e
  (In R, function "lm")
- Y is a linear function of X1
- B0 = intercept = regression constant
  - Predicted score on the outcame variable when all the xs are 0
- B1 = slope = regression coefficient
- e = error (residual)

  Multiple Regression (adding one) might look like:
  Y = B0 + B1X1 + B2x2 + e

R = multiple correlation coefficient
- R = rYY
- The correlation between the predicted scores and the observed scores

R2 (squared)
- the percentage of variance in Y explained by the model

The regression model is used to model or predict future behavior
- the model is just the regression equation
The goal is to product better models so we can generate more accurate predictions
- Add more predictor variables, and/or...
- Develop better predictor variables
