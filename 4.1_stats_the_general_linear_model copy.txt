***********************************
* The General Linear Model (GLM)  *
***********************************

GLM is the mathematical framework used in many commons statistical analyses, including multiple regression and ANOVA
 - ANOVA is typically presented as distinct from multiple regression but it IS a multiple regression

 * Characteristics:
  - Linear: pairs of variables are assumed to have linear relations
  - Additive: if one set of variables predict another variable, the effects are thought to be additive
    BUT! this does not preclude testing non-linear or non-additive effects

    GLM can accomodate such tests, for example, by
      * Transformation of variables
        - Transform so non-linear becomes linear
      * Moderation Analysis
        - Fake the GLM into testing non-additive effects

 * Examples
    
    * Simple Regression
    * Multiple Regression
    * Multiple Regression with additional non-additive term (to test for moderation), like:
      Y = B0, + B1X1 + B2X2 + B3X3 + e
        * Y = faculty salary
        * X1 = years since PhD
        * X2 = number of publications
        * X3 = (years x pubs) - a non-additive effect!

    * One-way ANOVA
      * Categorical predictors instead of continuous predictors
      * Y = B0 + B1X1 + e
        - Y = faculty salary
        - X1 = gender

    * Factorial ANOVA
      * Y = B0 + B1X1 + B2X2 + B3X3 + e
      Y = faculty salary
      X1 = gender
      X2 = race
      X3 = interaction(gender x race)

    ANOVA
      * Appropriate when the predictors (IVs) are all categorical and the outcome (DV) is continuous
        - most common application is to analyze data from randomized experiments
      * More specifically, randomized experiments that generate more than 2 means
        - if only 2 means then use:
          * Independent t-test
          * Dependent t-test
