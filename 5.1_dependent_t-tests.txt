* dependent t-tests *
***********************
- Also know as paired samples t-test
  - Appropriate when the same subjects are being compared
    - For example, pre/post design
  - Or when two samples are matched at the level of individual subjects
    - Allowing for a difference score to be calculated
  "one measure is dependent on the other => they're related"

  - A thorough analysis will include
    - t-value
    - p-value
    - Cohen's d (effect size)
    - Confidence interval (interval estimate)

  - t = (Observed - Expected) / SE
  - t = (M - 0) / SE = M / SE

  - p-value based on t-value and the t-distribution
  - Directional or non-directional test

  Supplement it with effect size:
  - Cohen's d
    - d = M/SD
    - "How much in SD units does 1 mean differ from another"

  CI
    - Upper Bound = M + t(SE)
    - Lower Bound = M - t(SE)

    -t-value depends on level of confidence and t-distribution

    t.test(australia.red, australia.white, paired=T)
      - r gives you an interval around the MEAN DIFFERENCE
    effect size:
      cohensD(australia.red, australia.white, method='paired')
      0.8021 (in SDs) - that would be significant
