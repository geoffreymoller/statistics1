* Correlation 
  - procedure used to measure and describe the relationship between two variables
  - can range between +1 & -1
  - think scatterplot
  - correlation does not imply causation
  - magnitude of Correlation depends on many factors, including:
    - sampling
    - measurement of x & y
  - the correlation coefficient is a sample statistic, just like the mean

* Calculation of little r
  - Raw score formula
  - Z-score formula

r = the degree to which X and Y vary together, relative to the degree to which X and Y vary inedpendently 
r = (Covariance of X & Y) / (Variance of X & Y)

* Variance = SD^^2 = MS = (SS/N)

To calculate SP:

(x - MsubX) x (Y - MsubY)
SP = âˆ‘[(X - MsubX) x (Y - MsubY)]

* Anscombe's Quartet - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe's_quartet

- normal distributions for X & Y
  - detect violations - plot hists and examine summary statistics
- linear relationship between X & Y
  - detect violations with scatterplots
- Homescedasticity
  - means that the distances are not related to the variable plotted on the X axis (they are not a function of X)
  - detect violations with scatterplots

- Reliability of X  & Y
- Validity of X & Y
- Random and representative sampling
