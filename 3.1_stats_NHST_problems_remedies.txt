Problems:
*********
* Biased by sample size
  - p-value is based on t-value
  - t = B/SE
  - SE = SQRT(SS.residual / (N-2))
  - (N is in the denominator)
    => high t-value is associated with a low p-value
  * A: supplement all NHSTs with estimates of effect size
    - for example, in regression, report standardized regression coefficients and the model R-squared

* Arbitrary Decision Rule
  - the cut-off value (alpha) is arbitrary
  - p < .05 is considered standard but still arbitrary
  - problems arise when p is close to .05 but not less than .05
  A: again, supplement NHST with estimates of effect size
    also, avoid phrases such as "marginally significant" or "highly significant"

* Yokel Local Test
  - Many researchers use NHST because it's the only approach they know
  - NHST encourages weak hypothesis testing
  * A: Learn other forms of hypothesis testing
    Consider multiple alternative hypothesis
      model comparison

* Error Prone
  - Type I errors
    probability of Type I errors increases when researchers conduct multiple NHSTs
    (multiple tests on the same data are dependent tests => requires correction)
  - Type II errors
    Many fields of research are plagued by a large degree of sampling error, which makes it difficult to detect an effect, even when the effect exists
    (Huge population and *relatively* small samples => large sampling error)

    A: Replicate significant effects to avoid long-term impact of Type 1 errors
      Obtain large and representative samples to avoid Type II errors

* Shady Logic
  - Modus tollens
  A: remember p = P(D | H0)

  - OR, avoid NHST, and 

  - Report Confidence Intervals only
  - Apply Bayesian inference
