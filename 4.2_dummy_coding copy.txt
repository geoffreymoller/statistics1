* Dummy Coding                    *
***********************************
- A system to code categorical variables/predictors
  - system to put a numerical value on each category/group
  - pick one level of your categorical independent variable and make it the reference (that one gets all zeroes across all the codes), as many codes as groups-1
    => allows you look at categorical predictors in the same model as continuous predictors

Example: 
  - IV: Area of research in a Psych department
    - cognitive
    - clinical
    - developmental
    - social
  - DV: Number of publications
