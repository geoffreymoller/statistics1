Types of variables
As you go down the list, you get more information and are able to ask more interesting questions => strive for interval or ratio variables, even though you can't always get it

From classic cognitive psychology

Nominal:
  Independent vars in experimental research
  Quasi-independent vars (concussion, gender, etc)

Interval & Ratio Vars:
  * Depenendent vars in experimental research
  * Measured vars in correlational research

Discrete vs. Continuous:
  - Nominal: Discrete
  - Interval & Ratio: Continuous
  - Ordinal Variables are technically discreet but they are often treated as continous in statistical analyses

* Nominal - used to assign individual cases to categories
  - ex: country of origin
  - permissible statistics: number of cases, mode, contingency correlation
  - basic empirical ops: determination of equality 

* Ordinal - used to rank order cases
  - ex: ranking
  - permissible statistics: median, percentiles 
  - basic empirical ops: determination of greater or less 

* Interval - also used to rank order, but distance between variables is constant
  - ex: longitude, latitude
  - permissible statistics: mean, sd, rank-order correlation, product-moment correlation 
  - basic empirical ops: determination of equality of intervals or difference 

* Ratio - same as interval, but it has a true "0 Point"
  - ex: population
  - ex: temperature on the kelvin scale
  - permissible statistics: coefficient of variation 
  - basic empirical ops: determination of equality of ratios
