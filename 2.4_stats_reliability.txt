* Reliability *
***************
X = true score + bias + error
A measure X is considered to be reliable as it approaches the true score
  - we don't know the true score, so we estimate reliability

Methods to estimate reliability
  - Test/re-test
  - Parallel tests
  - Inter-item estimates
    - most commonly used
      - Test / re-test ard parallel tests are time consuming
      - Inter-item is therefore more cost efficient
        - Randomly select 10 (of 20) items to get sub-set A
        - The other 10 items become sub-set B
        - The correlation between X1 and X2 is an estimate of reliability

************
* Validity *
************

- What is a construct
  - an ideal "object" that is not directly observable
    - as opposed to "real" observable objects
  
  - How to operationalize a construct
    - define it to make it observable and quantifiable
      - ex: intelligence tests  

  - Construct Validity:
    - Content Validity
      - Does the test consist of words that children in the populatio and sample should know
    - Convergent Validity
      - Does the test correlate with other, established measures of the same construct
    - Divergent Validity
      - Does the test correlate less well with measures designed to test a different type of ability?
    - Nomological Validity
      - Are scores onthe test consistent with more general theories, for example, of child development and neuroscience

* Measurement *
***************
- Random and representative sampling
- Sampling Error
  - The difference between the population and the sample
  - can't calculate it exactly, but we can estimate it 
    - BASED ON THE SIZE OF THE SAMPLE AND THE VARIANCE IN THE POPULATION
    - also depends on the variance in the population
    - big sample sizes are GREAT
- Standard Error
  - an estimate of the amount of the sampling error
  - SE = SD / SQRT(N)
