Assumptions when interpreting r
  (Almost identical to assumptions underlying correlation analysis)
- Normal distribution for Y
- Linear relationship between X and Y
- Homescedasticity
- Examine residuals to evaluate assumptions

  * Residual: The difference between the observed value of the dependent variable (y) and the predicted value (ŷ) is called the residual (e). Each data point has one residual.
  * Residual = Observed value - Predicted value 
  e = y - ŷ

  (run regression analysis and save the residuals, then)

To test assumptions, save residuals
  - then look at the residuals as a function of x
  - x on the x axis
    - residuals on the y-axis

  If you see a relationship between x and the residuals, there may be a confound in your study - don't have to be linear, but show and relationship and therefore violate linear regression
