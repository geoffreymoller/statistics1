* Mediation
*********************
- Mediation & Moderation sound alike but they are quite different
- Mediation says "what accounts for the relationship between X & Y"
- A mediation analysis is typicall conducted to better understand an observed effect of an IV on a DV or a correlation between X & Y
- Correlation does not imply causation. It's very difficult to get at the mechanisms behind correlation - Mediation is one tool to do that.
- A mediator variable (M) accounts for some or all of the relationship between X & Y
  - Some: Partial Mediation
  - All: Full mediation
    - THE DIRECT EFFECT IS NO LONGER SIGNIFICANT AFTER ADDING THE MEDIATOR INTO THE REGRESSION EQUATION
    - the Sobel test is significant

  !CAUTION
    - correlation does not imply causation!
    - In other words, there is a BIG difference between statistical mediation and true casual mediation

  HOW TO DO?
    FMTO: "for mediation to occur"
    Run three regression models
      lm(Y~X) Predict Y from X
        FMTO: Regression coefficient for X should be sigficant
      lm(M~X) Predict mediator from X 
        FMTO: Regression coefficient for X should be sigficant
      lm(Y~X+M) Predict Y from X and the mediator
        FMTO: Regression coefficient for M should be sigficant
          - what happens to the regression coefficient for X?

  **************************
  * Path Analysis Approach
  **************************
    Mediation analyses are typicall illustrated using "path models"
      - pm: form of structural equation models
        - Rectangles: Observed variables(X,Y,M)
        - Circles: Unobserved variables (e)
        - Triangles: Constants
        - Arrows: Associations (more on these later)

    In pm: a directional arrow *implies* causality
      - people start to slip here
      - if we're dealing with correlational data => NOT CAUSALITY

   * Sobel Test: An NHST that the indirect effect is 0


  Lab Hints:
    Is the change in R^2 significant?
      - Run Anova and look at the p-value
