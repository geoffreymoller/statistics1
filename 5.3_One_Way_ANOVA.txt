*  One-Way ANOVA *
******************
Analysis of Variance

* ANOVA is used to compare means, typically in experimental research
  - Categorical IV
  - Continuous DV
  - Evaluate with Levene's test
  - Post-hoc tests, such as Tukey's procedure, allow for multiple pairwise comparisons without an increase in the probability of a Type I error
  - A F-ratio tells us if there is a significant effect *somewhere* across our groups, but *where* is determined with post-hoc tests (which pairwise comparisons are significant)

* Appropriate when the predictors (IVs) are all categorical and the outcome (DV) is continuous
  - Most common application is to analyze data from randomized controlled experiments

  * More specifically, randomized controlled experiments that generate more than two group means    - If only two group means then use:
      - Independent t-test
      - Dependent t-test (AKA paired samples t-test)

  * If more than two group means then use:
    - Between groups ANOVA
    - Repeated measures ANOVA

    "NULL Hypothesis in ANOVA is that all groups are equal -> nothing is happening"

    Anova will tell us "is there a significant difference somewhere" -> that's what the f-ratio will us, then we'll do post-hoc tests

  * ANOVA typically involves NHST (but doesn't have to)
  * The test statistic if the F-test (F-ratio)
    - F = (Variance between groups) / (Variance within groups)
      - if you get 2 or 3 or more for the ratio, you probably have a significant effect

  * Like the t-test and family of t-distributions
  * The F-test has a family of F-distributions
    - The distribution to assume depends on 
      - Number of subjects per group
      - Number of groups

    Fisher's F
      - Ratio, so bounded at 0 (can't get negative values)
  
      F = between-groups variance / within-groups variance
      F = MS(between) / MS(within)
      F = MS(A) / MS(S/A)

      MS(A)  SS(A) / df(A)
      MS(S/A) = SS(S/A) / df(S/A)

Assumptions:
  * Continuous DV (interva or ratio)
  * DV is normally distributed
  * Homogeneity of variance
    - Verify with Levene's test
      - if Levene's is significant then homogeneity of variance assumption has been violated
        - conduct pairwise comparisons using a restricted error term
