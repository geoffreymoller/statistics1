Matrix Algebra

Important Concepts
  - Matrix addition/subtraction/multiplication
  - Special types of matrices
    * Correlation Matrix
    * Sum of squares / Sum of cross products matrix
    * Variance / Covariance Matrix

- A matrix is a rectangular table of know or unknown numbers
- Matrix Order
  Matrix algebra is "Really Cool"
    (the order of the matrix is 4x2 rows times columns)
- The "transpose" of a matrix is formed by rewriting its rows as columns
- Two matrices can be added or substracted ONLY IF they are of the same order
- Two matrices may be multiplied when the number of columns in the first matrix is equal to the number of rows in the second matrix
  - If so, then we say they are comformable for matrix multiplication
  - Resulting matrix is of order (rows in first) by (columns in second)
