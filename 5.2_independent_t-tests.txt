- WHEN THERE ARE MORE THAN TWO GROUP MEANS TO COMPARE, CONDUCT ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA)

- Compares two independent samples
  - For example, males & femails, control & experimental, patients & healthy controls
 
  - t-value
    - t = (Observed - Expected) / SE
    - t = (M1 - M2) / SE

    - SE = (SE1 + SE2) / 2

  - p-value
    - based on t-value and the t-distribution
    - Directional or no-directional test
  
  - Cohen's d
    - d = (M1 - M2) / SD(pooled)
    - where SD(pooled) = (SD1 + SD2) / 2

  CI
    - Upper Bound = M + t(SE)
    - Lower Bound = M - t(SE)

    -t-value depends on level of confidence and t-distribution

  * Homgeneity of variance assumption
    - The pooled SD is appropriate only if the variances in the two groups are equivalent
    - If not, then the homgeneity of variance assumption is violated
      * Simulations indicate this results in an increas in the probability of a Type I error

    - How to detect a violation:
      Conduct Levene's Test
        - if significant then the homogeneity of variance assumption is violated
    - What to do if violated?
      - (Might be telling you something interesting)
      - Adjust df and p-value (Welch's procedure)
      - Use a non-parametric test (Lecture 24)

- Conducting multiple t-tests like that 
  - Is tedious
  - Increases the probability of a Type I error
