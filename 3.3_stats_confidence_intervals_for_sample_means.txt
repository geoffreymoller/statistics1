* Confidence Intervals for sample means
**************************************
"Hard core statisticians would argue you're reporting confidence intervals to get away from the idea of statistical signifinace and NHST"

* All sample statistics, for example a sample mean (M), are point estimates

* The logic of confidence intervals is to report a range of values, rather than a single value
* In other words, report an *interval estimate* than a *point estimate*

CI: an interval estimate of a poulation parameter, based on a random sample
  - Degree of confidence, for example 95%, represents the probability that the interval captures the true population parametr

  - The main argument for interval estimates is the reality of sampling error
  - Sampling error implies that point estimates will vary from one study to the next
  - a researcher will therefore be more confident about accuracy with an interval estimate


* !! The width of the confidence interval is influenced by

  - Sample Size
  - Variance in the population (and sample)

  - CI Upper bound = M + t*SE
  - CI Lower bound = M + t*SE

  -> Standard Error (SE) = SD / SQRT(N)

  - t depends on the level of confidence desired and sample size

In regression, t = B (unstandardized) / SE
