Multiple Regression

GO AHEAD AND WATCH THIS AGAIN

Important Concepts
  - Multiple regression equation
  - interpretation of regression coefficients

  Simple Regression
    - just one predictor (X)
  Multiple Regression
    - Multiple predictors (X1, X2, X3, ...)

  Multiple Regression Equation

    - Just add more predictors (Multiple Xs)

    Y = B0 + B1X1 + B2X2 + B3X3 + ... + BkXk
    Y = B0 + âˆ‘(BxXk)

  R = multiple correlation coefficient
    - R = ryy
    - The correlation between the predicted scores and the the observed scores
  R^2
    - The percentage of variance in Y explained by the model

  Outcome measure (Y)
    - Faculty salary (Y)
  Predictors (X1, X2, X3)
    - Time since PhD (X1)
    - Number of publications (X2)
    - Gender (X3)

  lm(Salary ~ Time + Pubs + Gender)
