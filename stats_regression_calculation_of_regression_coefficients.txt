Important Concepts
  - Regression equation and model
  - Ordinary least squares estimation
  - Unstandardize regression coefficients
  - Standardized regression coefficients

The values of the coefficients are estimated such that the regression model yields optimal predictions

  - Minimize the residuals (prediction error)

  This is "Ordinary Least Squares" estimation
    - minimize the sum of the squared (SS) residuals

  Formula for the unstandardized regression coefficient
    - B1 = r x (SDy/SDx)

  Formula for the standardized regression coefficient
    (If you put everything into z-scores => SD === 1)
    - If X and Y are standardized then
      SDy = SDx = 1
      B = r x (SDy/SDx)
      β = r
        => the standardized regression coefficient (β) is equal to the correlation coefficient, BUT ONLY IN SIMPLE REGRESSION (ONE PREDICTOR)

  Unstandardized relationships say that for a one-raw-unit increment on a predictor, the outcome variable increases (or if B is negative, decreases) by a number of its raw units corresponding to what the B coefficient is.

  Standardized relationships say that for a one-standard deviation increment on a predictor, the outcome variable increasess (or decreases) by some number of SD's corresponding to what the β coefficient is.

  When should you use the unstandardized solution and when should you use the standardized one? My own view is as follows: If the raw units are generally familiar (e.g., years, dollars, inches, miles, pounds), I'd go with the unstandardized solution. However, if the variables' raw units are not well-known in everyday usage (e.g., on a marital-satisfaction inventory with a maximum score of 50, what does one point really convey?), then I'd use the standardized solution.
