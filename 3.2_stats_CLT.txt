* Sampling Distribution
  
  - a distribution of sample statistics, obtained from multiple samples
    - distribution of sample means
    - distribution of sample correlations 
    - distribution of sample regression coefficients 

  - It is hypothetical
    - assume a mean is calculated from a sample, obtained randomly from the population
    - assume a certain sample size, N
    - now, assume we had multiple random samples, all of size N, and therefore many sample means
    - collectively, they form a sampling distribution

  Histograms are used to display distributions
    - for example, body temperature of a random sample of healthy people
  - If a distribution is perfectly normal then the properties of the distribution are known
  - this allows for predictions about the distributions
    - predictions aren't certain
    - they are probabilistic

* Central Limit Theorem

  3 Principles
- The mean of the sampling distribution is the same as the mean of the population
  (!!!and if we're assuming that the null hypothesis is true => that mean will be 0)
- The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is the square root of the variance of sampling distribution
- !!! The shape of the sampling distribution is *approximately* normal if either (a) N >= 30 or (b) the of the population distribution is normal
  - what you get is a t-distribution (from the family of t-distributions) depending on sample size
  - as your sample size gets smaller, your t-distribution gets wider
  - => get the p-value by picking your t-distribution based on sample size, and then find the corresponding p-value

    * Multiple Regression

      - Assume the null hypothesis is true
      - Conduct a study
      - Calculate B, SE, and t
      - t = B/SE (regression coefficient / standard error)
        - it's a ratio of what we observed (rc, the slope relating x/y) relative to what we would expect due to chance
        - => if I get a t-value of 1, I observed my slope being exactly what is due to chance
        - => I want t-value of 2 or more to start improving my decision
        - each t-value has a corresponing p-value, but it depends on the sample size
        - p-value is a function of t and sample size
          - !!! it is the area under the curve at that particular t-value and beyond
            - if you have a high t, then you'll have a low p => you'll reject the null
            - if you have a low t, then you'll have a high p, you'll retain the null

      - If the null hypothesis is true (B = 0), then no one samples should have a very low or a very high B
      - I obtained of very high B
      - Therefore, reject the null hypothesis
      - Very high and very low is p < .05


      * Remember that sampling error and therefore standard error, is largely determined by sample size
