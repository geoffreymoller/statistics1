Question 1
Run a regression model with salary as the outcome variable and years of experience as the predictor variable. What is the 95% confidence interval for the regression coefficient? Type your answer exactly as it appears in R but include only two decimal places (for example, if the 95% confidence interval is -1 to +1 then type -1.00 1.00)
* salary$years  4930.12 6345.48

Question 2
Run a regression model with salary as the outcome variable and courses as the predictor variable. What is the 95% confidence interval for the regression coefficient?
* salary$courses   560.09 872.09

Question 3
Run a multiple regression model with both predictors and compare it with both the model from Question 1 and the model from Question 2. Is the model with both predictors significantly better than:
* 1. both single predictor models !! GET ANSWER
2. the single predictor model based on years of experience
3. the single predictor model based on courses
4. none of the above

Question 4
Run a standardized multiple regression model with both predictors. Do the confidence interval values differ from the corresponding unstandardized model?
* Yes
No

Question 5
What function could you use to take a random subset of the data?
sample

Question 6
Run the following command in R: set.seed(1). Now take a random subset of the original data so that N=15. Is the correlation coefficient between salary and years of experience in this sample higher or lower than in the whole data set?
Higher
* Lower

Question 7
Take a subset of the original data from row 51 to 70. What is the percentage of variance explained by a multiple regression model with both predictors (Provide your result with no decimal place)
* 85

Question 8
Using model comparison, which model provides the best fit for the subsetted data from Question 7?
model1.subset = lm(data.subset$salary ~ data.subset$years)
model2.subset = lm(data.subset$salary ~ data.subset$courses)
* model3.subset = lm(data.subset$salary ~ data.subset$years + data.subset$courses)
They are all equal
- model1.subset = lm(data.subset$salary ~ data.subset$years) AND model2.subset = lm(data.subset$salary ~ data.subset$courses) AND model3.subset = lm(data.subset$salary ~ data.subset$years + data.subset$courses) AND summary(model1.subset) AND summary(model2.subset) AND summary(model3.subset) AND anova(model1.subset, model3.subset) AND anova(model2.subset, model3.subset)

Question 9
What is the correlation between the salary values predicted by the multiple regression model and the actual salary scores in the subsetted data? (Provide your result rounded to 2 decimal places)
0.922422

Question 10
Compute the correlation between the scores predicted by the multiple regression model and the residuals from the same model. Is the correlation statistically significant?
Yes
* No
