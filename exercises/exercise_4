1. What is the correlation between salary and years of professional experience?
0.74 (.75)

2. What is the correlation between salary and courses completed? 
0.54

3. What is the percentage of variance explained in a regression model with salary as the outcome variable and professional experience as the predictor variable?
55 (56)

4. Compared to the model from Question 3, would a regression model predicting salary from the number of courses be considered a better fit to the data?
No

5. Now let's include both predictors (years of professional experience and courses completed) in a regression model with salary as the outcome. Now what is the percentage of variance explained? 
65

6. What is the standardized regression coefficient for years of professional experience, predicting salary? 
.74 (.75)

7. What is the standardized regression coefficient for courses completed, predicting salary?
.54

8. What is the mean of the salary distribution predicted by the model including both years of professional experience and courses completed as predictors? (with 0 decimal places)
75426

9. What is the mean of the residual distribution for the model predicting salary from both years of professional experience and courses completed? 
0

10. Are the residuals from the regression model with both predictors normally distributed?
Yes
