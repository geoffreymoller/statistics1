What is the correlation between S1 and S2 pre-training?
A: 0.49

What is the correlation between V1 and V2 pre-training?
A: 0.90

With respect to the measurement of two distinct constructs, spatial reasoning and verbal reasoning, the pattern of correlations pre-training reveals:
Convergent validity
Divergent validity
Both
Neither

Does there appear to be a correlation between spatial reasoning before training and the amount of improvement in spatial reasoning?
Yes
No
spacial_improvement <- (fitness$S1.post - fitness$S1.pre)
print(cor(fitness$S1.pre, spacial_improvement))
spacial_improvement2 <- (fitness$S2.post - fitness$S2.pre)
print(cor(fitness$S2.pre, spacial_improvement2))

[1] -0.07969478
A: No

Does there appear to be a correlation between verbal reasoning before training and the amount of improvement in verbal reasoning?
Yes
No
verbal_improvement <- (fitness$V1.post - fitness$V1.pre)
print(cor(fitness$V1.pre, verbal_improvement))
verbal_improvement2 <- (fitness$V2.post - fitness$V2.pre)
print(cor(fitness$V2.pre, verbal_improvement2))

[1] 0.05497685

Which group exhibited more improvement in spatial reasoning?
des
aer

Create a color scatterplot matrix for all 4 measures at pre-test. Do the scatterplots suggest two reliable and valid constructs?
Yes
No
base <- fitness[3:10]
base.r <- abs(cor(base))
base.color <- dmat.color(base.r)
base.order <- order.single(base.r)
cpairs(base, base.order, panel.colors = base.color, gap = .5, 
  main = "Variables Ordered and Colored by Correlation")
A: Yes

Create a color scatterplot matrix for all 4 measures at post-test. Do the scatterplots suggest two reliable and valid constructs?
Yes
No
A: Yes

What is the major change from pre-test to post-test visible on the color matrix?
Variance
Correlation coefficients
Construct validity
All of the above
A: Variance
